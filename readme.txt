Adds a few shortcodes to allow for accordion drop-downs.

== Description ==
Adds a few shortcodes to allow for accordion drop-downs.

**IMPORTANT:** If you are not comfortable with WordPress shortcodes, this plugin may not be for you. Additionally, you may want to be able to edit your themes main stylesheet in order to [add some custom CSS](http://wordpress.org/plugins/accordion-shortcodes/other_notes/#Other-Notes).

= Features =

* Adds two shortcodes for adding an accordion to your site
* No default CSS added
* Only adds JavaScript on pages that use the shortcodes
* Set the HTML tag for the title element of each item (optional)
* Open the first accordion item by default (optional)
* Open all accordion items by default (optional)
* Disable auto closing of accordion items (optional)
* Manually close items by clicking the title again (optional)
* Scroll page to title when it's clicked open (optional)

= The Shortcodes =

The two shortcodes that are added are:

`[accordion]`

and

`[accordion-item title=""]`

= Basic Usage Example =

    [accordion]
    [accordion-item title="Title of accordion item"]Drop-down content goes here.[/accordion-item]
    [accordion-item title="Second accordion item"]Drop-down content goes here.[/accordion-item]
    [/accordion]

This will output the following HTML:

    <div class="accordion">
        <h3 class="accordion-title">Title of accordion item</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            Drop-down content goes here.
        </div>
        <h3 class="accordion-title">Second accordion item</h3>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            Drop-down content goes here.
        </div>
    </div>

= Advanced Settings =

There are a few [advances settings](http://wordpress.org/plugins/accordion-shortcodes/other_notes/) for the plugin.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the 'accordion-shortcodes' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Add the shortcodes to your content.
4. Add some [CSS](http://wordpress.org/plugins/accordion-shortcodes/other_notes/#Other-Notes) to your themes stylesheet to make the accordion look the way you want.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't the JavaScript file loading on my site? =

This is most likely caused by a poorly coded theme. The plugin makes use of the `wp_footer()` function to load the JavaScript file and it's dependancy (jQuery). Check your theme to ensure that the `wp_footer()` function is being called right before the closing `</body>` tag in your themes footer.php file.

= How can I change the look of the accordion? =

No CSS is added by default to the accordion.

Changing the look and feel of the plugin requires you to be comfortable with editing your themes stylesheet. If you are familiar with that process, you can add some [CSS](http://wordpress.org/plugins/accordion-shortcodes/other_notes/#Other-Notes) to make the accordion look the way you want.

== Other Notes ==

= Sample CSS =

Here is some sample CSS to get you started if you want to customize the look and feel of the accordion.

    /* Accordion Styles */
    .accordion {
    	border-bottom: 1px solid #dbdbdb;
    	margin-bottom: 20px;
    }
    .accordion-title {
        border-top: 1px solid #dbdbdb;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 20px 0;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
    .accordion-title:hover {}
    .accordion-title:first-child {border: none;}
    .accordion-title.open {cursor: default;}
    .accordion-content {padding-bottom: 20px;}

= Advanced Settings =

There are a few advanced settings you can add to the opening accordion shortcode. The full shortcode, with all the default settings looks like this:

    [accordion autoclose="true" openfirst="false" openall="false" clicktoclose="false"]

**autoclose**: Sets whether accordion items close automatically when you open the next item. Set `autoclose="true/false"` on the opening accordion tag like this: `[accordion autoclose="false"]`. Default is `true`.

**openfirst**: Sets whether the first accordion item is open by default. This setting will be overridden if **openall** is set to true. Set `openfirst="true/false"` on the opening accordion tag like this: `[accordion openfirst="true"]`. Default is `false`.

**openall**: Sets whether all accordion items are open by default. It is recommened that this setting be used with **clicktoclose**. Set `openall="true/false"` on the opening accordion tag like this: `[accordion openall="true"]`. Default is `false`.

**clicktoclose**: Sets whether clicking an open title closes it. Set `clicktoclose="true/false"` on the opening accordion tag like this: `[accordion clicktoclose="true"]`. Default is `false`.

**scroll**: Sets whether to scroll to the title when it's clicked open. This is useful if you have a lot of content within your accordion items. Set `scroll="true/false"` on the opening accordion tag like this: `[accordion scroll="true"]`. Default is `false`.

You can also set the HTML tag for the titles of each item by added `tag="tagname"` to each `[accordion-item]` shortcode. Make sure to **not** include the angle brackets around the tag name. Example: to use `<h2>` instead of the default `<h3>` tag: `[accordion-item title="Item title" tag="h2"]Item content[/accordion-item]`
